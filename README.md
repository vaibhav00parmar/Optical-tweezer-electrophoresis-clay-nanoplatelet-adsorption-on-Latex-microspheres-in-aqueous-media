Data and codes for the paper 'Using optical tweezer electrophoresis to investigate clay nanoplatelet adsorption on Latex microsphere in aqueous media' by Vaibhav RS Parmar, S Chanda, Sri Vishnu BS and Ranjini Bandyopadhyay.

The folder 'OT-calibration' contains the MATLAB code and sample data to calculate the QPD sensitivity and trap stiffness using thermal fluctuations of the trapped microsphere.

The folder 'Surface charge and Stokes drag' contains the MATLAB codes and sample data 'trj.dat' to calculate the rotation angle, dimensionless parameter, and effective surface charge.

The folder 'cryoFESEM image analysis' contains Python code and sample data to calculate the standard deviation of sample stiffness.

The folder 'data' contains the data sets used to produce figures in the article.
